/**
 * This class is used to store the instance of the current active cell editor
 * for inline editing. As the {@link ICellEditor} does not know about the NatTable
 * instance it is activated in, and NatTable does not have some kind of global context
 * to register this information to, it is currently not possible to solve this in
 * another way. 
 * <p>
 * On activating a cell editor for inline editing, the activated cell editor will
 * be registered here. If the editor is closed, it needs to unregister itself.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Any position in code that needs to be aware of an open cell editor can request it
 * from here. This is especially necessary for automatic closing of cell editors on
 * other actions, e.g. trying to scroll with an activated editor which should lead
 * to close the editor first.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This can cause serious side effects if you are trying to create a custom editor
 * that is based on NatTable as editor control. This needs to be solved with some
 * kind of NatTable context where such instance can be registered (e.g. Dependency
 * Injection) and therefore will be addressed in a future architecture design.
 * </p>
